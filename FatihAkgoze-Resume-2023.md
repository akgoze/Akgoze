### <a name="_wo15d9cy9hz"></a>**Frontend Engineer | PARIBU - September 2022 -**
• I have been working at Paribu V4.0, a pivotal version for the company, since the beginning of 2022. Initially, I provided support to the design team, assisting them about the software development process. This involved collaborating closely with designers to seamlessly integrate design concepts into the development workflow.

• In September 2022, I transitioned to the Paribu Exchange Engineering Team as Frontend Engineer. In this position, my main responsibility was to develop the notification and announcement systems. Additionally, I took charge of managing the bugfix and test process, diligently identifying and resolving issues to maintain a stable and reliable system. With all these, by enhancing user experience and engagement, I contributed to the platform's success.

• Following the main release, I got role the responsibility of developing a global component library and design system, which ensured consistency and reusability across.

•I prepare the A/B testing environment for the user tests. When we cannot access the development side on any projects that we need to make A/B tests, I make the changes with JS and CSS on the client-side on the A/B test tools.

• If we couldn't use any test tool then I prepare the test environment manually with JavaScript.
